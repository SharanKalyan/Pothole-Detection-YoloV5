I have used the Yolov5x6.pt pretrained weight for training! I have trainied it for ~200 iterations and Here are some sample outputs!

The model can be leveraged to collect data and identify routes with higher pothole density. This information can be integrated with navigation systems, enabling the addition of a third routing option for users—‘Most Comfortable Route’—alongside the usual ‘Fastest’ and ‘Shortest’ options, prioritizing smoother roads for a better driving experience.
